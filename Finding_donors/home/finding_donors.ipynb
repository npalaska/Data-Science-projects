    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Logistic regression can be taken into consideration for any binary classification problem. Therefore any real world problem where the class labels are True or False, we may get good results using logistic regression. Some of the real world examples of logistic regression would be 1) Content based recommendation system where we detect whether a user will buy a product x or not based on his likes/dislkes or previous purchase history. 2) In medical studies where we can detect whether a person will catch the disease or not based on his medical history. \n",
    "- Logistic regression is linear classification model and hence may perform well when its a binary classification. When the problem is multiclass classification logistic regression treats it as a one VS rest problem. It is also easy to implement and very efficient to train.\n",
    "- Since it is a generalized linear model, its hypothesis space is limited so it may perform poorly for non-linear problems. It may also perform poorly when the data have lot of missing values. It may also tend to overfit the model if the regularization is not properly used.\n",
    "- Our problem is essentially a binary classification problem and we also do not have missing values in our dataset. Scaling or normalizing the data is also not very important for logistic regression. This makes Logistic regression a good candidate for experimentation on our dataset.\n",

    "- Support Vector Machines are great statistical algorithm for binary as well as multiclass classification problem. They can create non linear classification boundries. SVM can be used for image classfication or image recognition; one of the typical application is face recognition where SVM classify different parts of the images as a face and non-face based on training data of nXn pixels with two classes first is face (1) and second non-face (0). SVM can also be used for classifying documents or texts into different categories (multi-class classification). \n",
    "- SVM is Effective in high dimensional spaces and it also creates a non-linear hypothesis space and therefore it can handle any class label distribution using powerful kernel tricks. Regularisation parameter, helps avoiding over-fitting the data. \n",
    "- One of the disadvantage of SVM is that it is very sensitive to the hyper-parameter (C) and can quickly overfit or uderfit the data based on the wrong values of hyper-parameter. It also takes longer to train on large data sets. It is also Difficult to understand the final model and impact of individual hyper-parameter. SVM may also perform poorly on highly skewd datasets.\n",

    "- Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm for classification. In a more informal notion its a forest of multiple randomized decision trees. Random Forest algorithm can be used in many different fields but one of the popular use case is banking where banking systems can use the algorithm to detect potential customers who will use their specific schemes based on banking history and location of that user. It can also be used for detecting fraud transactions or future stock market trends. \n",
    "- Random Forest is an easy to understand algorithm and very effective when the dataset contains more catagorical information. Random forest can be used for classification or regression problems. Random forest because of its randomnness in splitting the feature-set usually stabilize bias and variance of the model resulting in more robust ML model. Hyperparameters are straightforward to understand and model usually do not result in overfitting. \n",
    "- One of the main disadvantage of random forest is that, because it form lot of decision trees it may quickly train the model but could be time consuming to generate predictions. It also sometime perform poorly when the datasets are imbalanced; meaning one of the class label has significantly less data samples than others. \n",
    "- Our dataset has a lot of catogorical information which is suited for random forest algorithm and it is easy to view the relative importance it assigns to the input features. Since random forest also tends to minimize the overfitting and produce better classification models it should be considered as a candidate for our experimentation \n",

    "- Adaboost is an another ensemble learning algorithm for classification. It uses multiple weak learners and their votes to make final predictions. One of the classic example of adaboost is image detection such as face recognition using nXn pixels data.\n",
    "- One of the strength of adaboost classfiers is that it can provide good generalization; It tries to boost the performance of base classifier model mostly decision tree. Therefore it can said that Adaboost algorithm acts like a wrapper around the base classifier. It is often computationally faster relative to other classification algorithms such as SVM. Adaboost can be used for any distribution of datasets since it can generate non-linear decision boundries \n",
    "- One of the disadvanges of Adaboost is that it is dependant on the base model on which it tries to boost the decisions. Therefore if the underlying classifier is not best suited for the application, then Adaboost too may perform poorly since it can not boost performance beyond certain limit.\n",
    "- Ensemble methods usually genrate non-linear boundries. Since we have many catogorical features we can use decision tree as a base classifier model (weak learner). Adaboost also works relatively good when we have imbalance of class label in our dataset which make Adaboost a serious candidate for our experimentation.  \n",

    "Of the five higher weighing features determined by Adaboost classifier, 3 of them matches with our earlier assumption which are education, age and hours-per-week, although with different rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms our understanding of features such as education, age and hours-per-week as to why they are important in determining whether a person will earn more than 50K or not. Two of the other features included by Adaboost are capital-gain and capital loss; the reason I did not included them in my naive guess is maybe because I lack the complete understanding of this specific features. If the feature is related to the stock or other investment profits/loss, this definately make sense since people earning more profits from stocks or investments may likely earn more than 50K a year. \n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
