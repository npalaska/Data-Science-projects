## Seattle Airbnb analysis
### Installation

I used python 3.5 for this project and the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn

I installed all of them using Anaconda distribution. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/

### Project Motivation
This is part of my data science project at Udacity. I as an independent researcher was interested in finding some 
interesting insights from the Airbnb Seattle data that could help visitors to find some answers they might be looking 
for as well as helping the homeowners to understand the market.

Some of the business questions I tried to find answers for:
1. How the price for Airbnb listings fluctuate over the year
2. What are some of the busiest time to visit the Seattle 
2. Is it possible to predict the price of a listing based on all the available features
3. What factors impact the most in determining the cost of Airbnb listings

I followed the CRISP-DM methodology for researching the answers for these questions which includes intermediary steps 
towards Data understanding, Data cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Modelling and visualizing the results.
